# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions in Go

## Overview

Welcome to my repository! This project contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges, implemented in Go.

## Why Go?

I chose Go for its simplicity, performance, and strong standard library. It's a great language for solving algorithmic challenges and allows for quick prototyping.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Go 1.21 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:MatteoGaetzner/aoc-2022-go.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```bash
    cd aoc-2022-go
    ```

3. Run the solution for a specific day (e.g., day 1):

    ```bash
    cd day-01
    go run main.go
    ```

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

-   Each day's challenge has its own directory, named `day-XX`, where `XX` is the day of the challenge (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`, etc.).
-   Inside each directory, you'll find a `main.go` file that contains the solution for that specific day.
